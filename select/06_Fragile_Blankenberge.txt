Every time when you
Remember all the things
That happened to you before
And it seems like everything goes wrong

Your heart is so fragile
You never could believe anyone
But all we need someone
To help us understand this life

You're always looking for a trap
You're asking why this life can not be safe
You need control on every step
But the only thing you need is faith

Your heart is so fragile
But you can't live like this anymore
Maybe it won't be fine
But nothing left to wait for

Your heart is so fragile
You never could believe anyone
But all we need someone
To help us understand this life
