Haath pakad kar chalte rahe, saath samundar chod gaye, andhiyaari se roshni tak,
Aa hi gaye hum aa hi gaye (hindi)

Inside the dark, deepest part of my mind. Through sunshine and rain, idle dreams keep my sane.

We're only feathers in the wind falling from the sky without wings and
Though the world may fall I know, I see sunlight through the rain over me.

Beyond the dark lie the hopes and the fears. Innocent eyes watching as worlds collide

We're only feathers in the wind falling from the sky without wings and
Though the world may fall I know, I see sunlight through the rain over me

Haath pakad kar chalte rahe, saath samundar chod gaye, andhiyaari se roshni tak,
Aa hi gaye hum aa hi gaye

Inside my head i can be anything (x 5 and fade)
